At some point your interviewer will ask: How are you with teamwork 

Why? Software dev is a team sport. Most information work is a team sport

Basics: 

High trust

What is good teamwork for?
- making sure the project is successful
- by setting your team mates up for success


Communicate openly 
- clarity and precision
- ask for help 
- set your helper up for success 
- trust transparency 
- psychological safety 



Make good decisions
- decision arenas 
- make sure you hear people out 
- beware anchoring
- beware hippos

Async comms 
- ack 
- headspace 


Code review:
- short and complete cycles 


Pass the ball well 
Do your part 
Don't hog the ball 

Prioritisation:
- risk first
- handovers first 
- bias to finish: balls all over the place 

Retrospective: look back and learn 
- I was frustrated when, I was happy that... 
- Be a human 
- Try to be a better team 

Teams are made up of people. Humans are prone to human errors. 
- Automation helps but so does humanity 
- Eg: big data-dump meetings are not good for attention spans


Onboarding and memory:
- documentation
- nice git messages 

Clean code
- always consider the next developer as your client
- the next developer knows where you live 
- No "it works on my machine"
- stick to the conventions in place unless you intentionally want to change the conventions 
- KISS

Tests 

Know where all the players are:
- good project management practices
- kanban board


Be willing to give and recieve accutate feedback

Be on time, if you say you will be there, be there! 

Documentation:
- single source of truth
- set everyone up for success 


The right tool for the job:
- wikis
- notion or trello

Multiple skills:
- designers should pass work over in useful format + respect insights
- try to understand the needs of the business, not just your own 
- technical debt thoughts
    - dont be careless an leave rubbish for other people to clean up 
- dont care about 10x developers, rather 100x teams 

Soft skills 
- can be well defined
- intentionally practiced and shared
